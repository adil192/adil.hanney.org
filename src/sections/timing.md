Timing Trainer presents you with a blinking square and you guess the time between blinks.
As you play, you'll get better at recognizing sub-second intervals.

I first created this game/trainer as a PWA (progressive web app)
[here](https://adil.hanney.org/timing/).
Later, since it was a very simple app,
I made a cross-platform version as my first foray into Flutter.

The Flutter version is available on all major platforms and
[online](https://adil.hanney.org/timing_flutter/).
