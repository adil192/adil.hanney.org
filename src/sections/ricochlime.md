Ricochlime is a satisfying ~~slime~~ monster shooter game.
The name was originally a portmanteau of "ricochet" and "slime",
but I've since had to switch out the graphics for licensing reasons
so there aren't any slimes anymore!

I made Ricochlime to experiment with making a game in Flutter
using the Flame game engine.

Ricochlime is available on all major platforms and
[online](https://ricochlime.adil.hanney.org).
