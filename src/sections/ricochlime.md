Ricochlime is a satisfying ~~slime~~ monster shooter game.
The name was originally a portmanteau of "ricochet" and "slime",
but I've since had to switch out the graphics for licensing reasons
so there aren't any slimes anymore! I developed Ricochlime to experiment
with making a game in Flutter using the Flame game engine.

I designed this to be a simple, easy, satisfying game to play.
I often like to have something to do with my hands while I'm focusing on something else,
and I find that games like this are perfect for that.
The music is disabled by default, and
the only ads in the app are a banner at the bottom of the screen,
which I find is a good compromise between monetisation and user experience.

Ricochlime is available on all major platforms and
