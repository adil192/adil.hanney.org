Saber is a notes app designed for handwriting.

It's designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible, while still delivering uniquely useful features.

Notably, it can invert your notes when you're in dark mode. This allows you to write with white ink on a black background, and Saber avoids the common pitfall of leaving the background of images white while everything else is inverted.

Saber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from anyone but you, even if they have total control over the server. You can also choose to use the default server, another server, or host your own.

Saber is available on all major platforms; find out more at [saber.adil.hanney.org](https://saber.adil.hanney.org) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/saber-notes/saber).
