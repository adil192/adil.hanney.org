Saber is the notes app built for handwriting. It was my first non-trivial Flutter project, and I've been working on it since July 2022.

I'd been writing digital notes since 2020, and the only app that suited my needs was [Samsung Notes](https://www.samsung.com/uk/apps/samsung-notes/).
Unfortunately, it was only compatible with Samsung's Android devices and select Windows devices. Additionally, it didn't work on Samsung's Android devices with custom firmware, such as LineageOS, which I was using at the time on my Samsung phone. I wanted to be able to access my notes on all my devices, regardless of the operating system or manufacturer.

I'd been wanting to make my own notes app for a while and in the summer holidays of 2022, I restumbled upon Flutter and finally decided to give it a go. Nowadays, Saber has likely* tens of thousands of users, and it's advancing at a rapid pace. (*I don't directly track users, but some partial data is available from various sources.)

Developing Saber was (and is continuing to be) a huge learning experience for me. I've successfully deployed custom GLSL shaders, continual performance optimisations, CI/CD workflows on GitHub Actions, backwards compatibility for new features, [adaptive and responsive UIs](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/responsive/adaptive-responsive#the-difference-between-an-adaptive-and-a-responsive-app), [reusable packages](https://pub.dev/packages?q=publisher%3Aadil.hanney.org+show%3Aunlisted), and much more.

Saber is available on all major platforms; find out more at [saber.adil.hanney.org](https://saber.adil.hanney.org) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/saber-notes/saber).
